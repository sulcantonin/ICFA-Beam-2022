## Talk: Status of Data-Driven Beam Trajectory Anomaly Detection at European XFEL
IPAC'22 Conference Contribution https://github.com/sulcantonin/BPM_IPAC22

_An accurate assessment of beam orbits is a reliable characteristic of operations at SASE beamlines at European XFEL. The current availability of hardware for data-driven models like GPUs enabled to deploy models which are capable of handling enormous throughput of data provide tools for more sophisticated analysis of current operations with state-of-the-art machine learning models. In this work, we are showing our current progress of beam orbit analysis at European XFEL with pure model-free data-driven tools.
We examine more advanced models which take the intra-bunching properties into consideration and analyze beam operations with various anomaly detection methods._
